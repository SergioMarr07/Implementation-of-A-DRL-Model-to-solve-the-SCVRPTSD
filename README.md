# Implementation of a DRL Model to Solve the SCVRPTSD

This repository contains the implementation of a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approach to solve the **Stochastic Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Services and Deadlines (SCVRPTSD)**. This work is part of a paper under revision by my teamwork, which extends the Policy Optimization with Multiple Optima (POMO) algorithm to address the stochastic and time-sensitive nature of the problem.

## Problem Overview

The SCVRPTSD is a variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), where:
- One or more vehicles with fixed capacities must complete a series of deliveries distributed throughout a city.
- Each route begins and ends at a central distribution depot.
- Time constraints and uncertain travel times between locations are considered.
- The goal is to minimize total travel time while ensuring that all deliveries are made within their deadlines.

## Key Features

- **Algorithm**: Extends the POMO algorithm by introducing modifications to the environment and integrating a new dynamic context within the Neural Network Model (NNM).
- **Environment**: Models a delivery system with stochastic travel times and time-sensitive constraints.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Compared against Google OR-Tools and various metaheuristics as benchmarks.

## Results

The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through extensive experiments. Below are some key performance metrics:

### Total Travel Time and Out-of-Schedule Deliveries

#### Case 1: Instances with $n=50$ customers
